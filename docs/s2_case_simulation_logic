the complete data flow! Here's what's happening:

  Answer: The codebase uses BOTH therapist input AND mock data

  Data Flow:

  1. Therapist Input: Therapists enter their ideal patient description in the
  PatientDescriptionForm component during the S2 onboarding process. This gets saved to the
  s2_patient_descriptions table.
  2. Mock Scenario Generation: When a scenario needs to be generated, the code currently uses
  mock data instead of real AI generation:

    - Line 114 in generate-scenario/route.ts: generation_model: 'mock-anthropic-claude'
    - Line 102: const scenario = await generateMockScenario(patientDescription);
    - Lines 157-203: The generateMockScenario() function contains pre-written scenario templates
  3. The Mock Process:
    - Takes the therapist's actual patient description
    - Analyzes it for keywords (anxiety, depression, trauma, relationships)
    - Selects a matching pre-written scenario template from lines 162-183
    - Returns scenarios like "Meet Alex, a 32-year-old marketing professional experiencing panic
   attacks at work..."
  4. Why "mock-anthropic-claude":
    - Line 97: // TODO: Integrate with Anthropic Claude API
    - The real Anthropic integration is not implemented yet
    - It's using mock scenarios as placeholders

  Current State:

  - ✅ Therapist input: Real data from therapists about their ideal patients
  - ❌ AI generation: Currently mocked with pre-written templates
  - ✅ Scenario matching: Uses therapist input to select appropriate mock scenarios

  The "Meet Alex" scenario you're seeing is one of the anxiety-related templates that gets
  selected when the therapist's patient description contains anxiety-related keywords.
