## Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and development experience
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Isolated mobile config to prevent build conflicts
- **Type Safety**: Cross-platform compatible type definitions
- **React Navigation**: Screen navigation and routing

### State Management & Data
- **Zustand**: Existing WebRTC store and state management

- **Firebase**: Authentication and user management

#### Shared Database Architecture
The React Native app uses the **exact same Supabase tables** as the web application, providing:
- **Cross-platform data continuity**: Start conversations on web, continue on mobile
- **Unified user profiles**: User memory and preferences persist across platforms
- **Same AI behavior**: Identical prompts, functions, and specialist configurations
- **Real-time sync**: Changes made on one platform immediately available on the other
- **No data duplication**: Single source of truth for all user data and conversations

### Audio & Communication
- **WebRTC**: Real-time voice communication
- **React Native Voice**: Speech-to-text capabilities
- **Audio recording libraries**: For voice message capture

### UI & Styling
- **NativeWind**: Tailwind CSS for React Native
- **React Native Vector Icons**: Icon library
- **React Native Reanimated**: Smooth animations for audio orb

## TypeScript Configuration

### Cross-Platform Type Safety
- **Separate `tsconfig.json`** for mobile project in `/mobile` folder
- **Web app excludes mobile folder**: `"exclude": ["node_modules", "mobile"]` in root tsconfig
- **Handle FormData type differences** between web and mobile environments
- **Use `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>`** for cross-platform timeout compatibility
- **Isolated dependency management** prevents type conflicts between platforms

### Mobile-Specific TypeScript Setup
```json
// mobile/tsconfig.json
{
  "extends": "expo/tsconfig.base",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    },
    "strict": true
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".expo/types/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

### Root TypeScript Configuration
```json
// Root tsconfig.json (for Next.js web app)
{
  "compilerOptions": { /* ... */ },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".next/types/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "mobile"]  // ← Excludes mobile folder
}
```
