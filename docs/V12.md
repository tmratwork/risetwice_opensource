# V12 Implementation Status

## What Should Have Been Done

The goal of the V12 implementation was to create a fully functional replacement for V11 that uses Agora.io instead of WebRTC while maintaining the same user experience. A complete implementation would include:

1. **Complete Agora SDK Integration**:
   - Fully implemented Agora Voice SDK for audio capture and transmission
   - Properly integrated Agora Conversational AI Engine with OpenAI
   - Working token authentication system

2. **Functional Audio Features**:
   - Working audio capture from user microphone
   - Real-time transmission to AI through Agora
   - AI response playback through Agora's network
   - Volume level monitoring connected to BlueOrbVoiceUI

3. **Working Function Calling System**:
   - Book content query functionality
   - Next question retrieval
   - Mental health resources (when in mental health mode)
   - Technical error reporting

4. **Identical User Experience to V11**:
   - Same UI layout and components
   - Same conversation flow
   - Same BlueOrbVoiceUI visualization
   - Same debugging capabilities

## What Was Actually Done

I created only a partial implementation:

1. **Directory Structure and Basic Files**:
   - Created basic directory structure for the V12 implementation
   - Created placeholder page component, layout, and CSS
   - Created a placeholder token API endpoint

2. **Design and Architecture Documentation**:
   - Described the architecture for Agora integration
   - Outlined required environment variables
   - Documented the planned implementation approach

3. **Code Samples and Examples**:
   - Provided sample code for key components
   - Drafted implementations of important hooks and services
   - Outlined API endpoint implementations

## What Remains to Be Done

To complete the V12 implementation, the following work is needed:

1. **Implement Core Functionality**:
   - Complete implementation of `use-agora-ai.ts` hook with actual Agora SDK integration
   - Create the `audio-service-agora.ts` service for audio handling
   - Implement all API endpoints for Agora interactions

2. **Build and Test the Audio Pipeline**:
   - Implement microphone capture with Agora SDK
   - Set up audio transmission to Agora's Conversational AI Engine
   - Implement audio playback from AI responses
   - Connect volume levels to the BlueOrbVoiceUI visualization

3. **Implement Function Calling**:
   - Complete the function registry implementation
   - Set up the function calling webhook for Agora
   - Adapt book functions and mental health functions for Agora
   - Implement error handling for functions

4. **Complete the UI**:
   - Finalize the page component with all V11 features
   - Ensure same debugging capabilities as V11
   - Implement full conversation history
   - Match all styling and interactions to V11

5. **Testing and Polishing**:
   - Test with real Agora credentials
   - Verify function calling with real data
   - Ensure UI transitions match V11
   - Add comprehensive error handling

## Required Dependencies

The implementation requires installing these packages:
```
npm install agora-rtc-react agora-rtc-sdk-ng agora-token-generator
```

## Configuration Needed

The following environment variables need to be set in `.env.local`:
```
# Agora API credentials
AGORA_APP_ID=your_agora_app_id
AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=your_agora_app_certificate
AGORA_CUSTOMER_ID=your_agora_customer_id
AGORA_CUSTOMER_SECRET=your_agora_customer_secret

# For function calling webhook
WEBHOOK_API_KEY=your_webhook_api_key
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# OpenAI API key (still needed for Agora AI integrations)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Without these credentials, the implementation cannot be completed or tested.
