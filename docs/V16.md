# V16 Triage AI Architecture Specification

## Overview
V16 implements a triage AI system that routes conversations to specialized AI agents based on user intent and context, similar to how an emergency room doctor handles emergencies and triages the rest to specialized doctors. AI instructions are loaded from Supabase table - if loading fails, that is a breaking error.

**Simple Handoff Model**: Triage AI talks with user ‚Üí User agrees to specialist ‚Üí Triage AI disconnects ‚Üí Specialist AI connects (new session with different AI instructions)

## Core Functionality
- Mental health support focus
- Voice and text input (like V15)
- Triage AI assesses and routes to specialists
- Clean session handoffs between AIs

## Triage System Design

### Routing Criteria
- **Intent Detection Method**: ONLY AI analysis
- **Routing Rules**:
  - determine from triage and specialized AI prompts

### Specialized AI Agents
1. **Mental Health Specialist**
   - describes in prompts

## Technical Implementation

### Triage Level
- **Operating Level**: Session-based (users can talk or type like V15)
- **Re-routing**: Clean disconnect/reconnect - not mid-stream. Triage session ends, specialist session begins
- **Fallback**: If triage AI cannot recommend a specialist, it communicates this to the user and continues the conversation

### Context Management
- **Context Passing Method**:
  - Summary/key points only
- **Context Format**: Markdown (more flexible, works well with both Claude and OpenAI Realtime API)

### Integration Architecture

#### WebRTC/OpenAI Integration
- **Connection Model**: One AI at a time (never concurrent)
- **Audio Handling**: Single WebRTC stream reused across sessions
- **Handoff Flow**:
  1. Triage AI explains handoff and gets user consent
  2. Triage AI disconnects completely
  3. Specialist AI connects with new instructions
  4. Clean session transition (no overlap)

#### User Experience
- **Handoff Style**: 
  - [ ] Announced (AI explains the handoff)
- **Specialist Identification**: specialized AI's introduce themselves in the initial message, along with how they would like to address user's specific issue

## Data and State Management

### Memory System Architecture
- **Profile Sharing**: Shared
- **Memory Updates**:
  - all agents can update user profiles
  - Conflict resolution between specialists is up to AI

### Logging and Analytics
- **Triage Decisions**:
  - What to log: same things that are usually logged after a chat conversation
  - Storage location: use V15 approach to logging
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Routing accuracy
  - User satisfaction per specialist
  - Handoff success rate

## Database Schema Changes

### Existing Tables Used
- `ai_prompts` table (already exists for storing prompts)
- `conversations` table from V15
- `messages` table from V15
- `user_profiles` table from V15

### New Columns Needed
```sql
-- Add specialist tracking to conversations table
ALTER TABLE conversations 
ADD COLUMN current_specialist TEXT,
ADD COLUMN specialist_history JSONB DEFAULT '[]';

-- Add routing metadata to messages table
ALTER TABLE messages
ADD COLUMN routing_metadata JSONB;
```

### Minimal Changes Approach
- Reuse existing V15 tables
- Add only essential columns for tracking specialists
- Store routing decisions in existing logging structure


## API Structure

### New Endpoints
- `/api/v16/load-prompt` - Load AI prompt from Supabase
- `/api/v16/start-session` - Start triage or specialist session
- `/api/v16/end-session` - Clean disconnect before handoff

### V16 Implementation
- Create new `/chatbotV16` page (copy from V15)
- Reuse V15 endpoints for conversation/message/memory
- Add specialist tracking to existing tables

## Implementation Status ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Basic Setup (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Added `current_specialist` and `specialist_history` columns to `conversations` table, `routing_metadata` column to `messages` table
- ‚úÖ **V16 Page**: Created `/chatbotV16` page based on V15 with triage AI architecture
- ‚úÖ **Load Prompt API**: Created `/api/v16/load-prompt` endpoint that loads prompts from `ai_prompts` Supabase table with breaking error handling

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Triage Implementation (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ **Triage AI Loading**: V16 loads triage AI prompt on initial connection from Supabase
- ‚úÖ **Handoff Flow**: Implemented complete 5-step handoff process:
  1. Triage AI gets user consent and creates context summary
  2. Clean session termination via `/api/v16/end-session`
  3. WebRTC disconnection with 1-second delay
  4. Specialist session start via `/api/v16/start-session`
  5. WebRTC reconnection with specialist AI prompt
- ‚úÖ **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses `specialist_handoff` events for clean transitions
- ‚úÖ **Session State Management**: Tracks handoff status, specialist history, and context summaries

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Specialist Connection (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Prompt Loading**: Loads specialist prompts based on triage routing decisions
- ‚úÖ **Context Continuity**: Passes context summaries between triage and specialist sessions
- ‚úÖ **Voice/Personality Switching**: Supports unique voice settings per AI specialist
- ‚úÖ **Specialist Tracking**: Updates conversation records with specialist history and metadata

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Integration (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ **V15 Memory System**: Reuses existing V15 conversation/message/memory endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Database Integration**: Uses existing V15 tables with minimal new columns
- ‚úÖ **Function Registration**: Reuses V15 function registration system for mental health and book functions
- ‚úÖ **Audio/UI Components**: Reuses V15 audio orb and UI components

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Admin Interface (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ **Admin Dashboard**: Updated `/chatbotV15/admin` to include V16 prompt management
- ‚úÖ **Prompt Editor**: Created `/chatbotV15/admin/v16-prompt/[promptId]` for editing all 9 AI types
- ‚úÖ **API Management**: Created `/api/v16/admin/ai-prompts` for CRUD operations on V16 prompts
- ‚úÖ **Voice/Metadata Config**: Support for JSON voice settings and metadata per specialist

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Comprehensive Logging (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ **Structured Logging**: All V16 operations use `[V16]` prefix for easy filtering
- ‚úÖ **Handoff Monitoring**: Detailed step-by-step logging of 5-phase handoff process
- ‚úÖ **API Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of all API calls with context data
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting with breaking error patterns
- ‚úÖ **Performance Metrics**: Timing data, content lengths, and operation success tracking

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Prompt loading from Supabase
  - Routing decision logic
  - Context summarization
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Full handoff flow
  - Voice transitions
  - Memory system updates
- **Performance Tests**:
  - Latency during handoffs
  - Concurrent user handling

- **Database**: Requires SQL schema updates to be applied
- **Configuration**: All 9 AI specialists can be configured via admin interface

## Recent Updates (June 2025)

### ‚úÖ V16 Function Architecture Implementation 
**Problem Solved**: Triage AI was saying it would hand off to specialists but nothing happened because it lacked the function to actually trigger handoffs.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **V16 Function Isolation**: Created dedicated V16 function system (`/src/app/chatbotV16/prompts/function-descriptions-mh.ts`) isolated from V15
- **V16 Function Registration**: Built V16-specific hook (`/src/hooksV16/use-function-registration.ts`) that uses V16 functions instead of V15
- **Handoff Function Added**: Implemented `trigger_specialist_handoff` function that triage AI can call to programmatically initiate specialist handoffs
- **Event Integration**: Function dispatches `specialist_handoff` custom events that V16 page already listens for to execute the 5-step handoff process
- **V16 Page Updated**: Modified V16 page to use V16 function registration instead of V15

**Technical Details**:
- Function count: 37 functions (36 from V15 + 1 new handoff function)
- Event-driven: Uses `window.dispatchEvent()` to trigger handoffs
- Zero V15 impact: V15 continues using original functions unchanged
- TypeScript compliant: All code compiles successfully

**Expected Behavior**: Triage AI can now call `trigger_specialist_handoff("practical_support", "reason", "context", "urgency")` to actually execute handoffs rather than just mentioning them in text.

## CRITICAL: Conversation ID Management (July 2025)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CONVERSATION ID SYNCHRONIZATION REQUIREMENTS

**NEVER create client-side conversation IDs.** V16 had a critical bug where handoffs failed because of UUID format mismatches. Here's what you MUST do:

#### ‚ùå WRONG APPROACH (Causes UUID Errors):
```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS - Client-side ID generation
const conversationId = `conv-${Date.now()}`;  // ‚ùå NOT A VALID UUID
localStorage.setItem('currentConversationId', conversationId);
```

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH (Database-First):
```typescript
// DO THIS - Use WebRTC store as single source of truth
const conversationId = await webrtcStore.createConversation(); // ‚úÖ Proper UUID from database
webrtcStore.setConversationId(conversationId); // ‚úÖ Syncs to localStorage automatically
```

#### üîó Required Synchronization Pattern:
1. **WebRTC Store** = Single source of truth for conversation creation
2. **localStorage** = Automatically synced copy for handoff functions  
3. **Database** = Always creates proper UUIDs, never client-side strings

#### üö® Key Implementation Rules:
- **ALL conversation creation** MUST go through WebRTC store's `createConversation()` method
- **NEVER generate** conversation IDs with timestamps or client-side logic
- **ALWAYS sync** WebRTC store conversation ID to localStorage for handoff compatibility
- **USE database-generated UUIDs** for all conversation operations

#### üìç Critical Code Locations:
- `/src/stores/webrtc-store.ts` lines 2132-2136: Syncs new conversations to localStorage
- `/src/stores/webrtc-store.ts` lines 2269-2279: Syncs resumed conversations to localStorage  
- `/src/hooksV16/use-supabase-functions.ts` lines 321-349: Gets conversation ID for handoffs

This synchronization prevents "invalid input syntax for type uuid" errors during specialist handoffs.

## Recent Updates (June 2025) - Phase 1 Function Management

### ‚úÖ V16 Per-AI Function System Implementation 
**Problem Solved**: All V16 AIs were sharing the same hardcoded 37 functions from a single file. Each AI specialist needed its own unique functions plus universal functions.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Database Schema**: Added `functions` JSONB column to existing `ai_prompts` table for storing per-AI function definitions
- **Function Templates Table**: Created `function_templates` table to store the 37 existing functions as selectable templates
- **Tab-based Admin UI**: Added "Functions" tab alongside "Prompts" tab in each AI specialist's admin page
- **Template Dropdown System**: Dropdown selector allowing admins to add any of the 37 function templates to each AI
- **JSON Editor**: Full function definition editor with validation, syntax checking, and error reporting
- **Universal Function Merging**: Automatic merging system like prompts - each AI gets its unique functions + universal functions
- **Preview System**: Shows the final merged function list that will be sent to the AI
- **API Integration**: Updated all V16 endpoints to handle functions field in database operations

**Technical Architecture**:
- **Per-AI Functions**: Each of the 9 AI specialists can have completely different function sets
- **Universal Functions**: Special `universal_functions` row in `ai_prompts` table stores functions shared by all AIs
- **Automatic Merging**: Like prompts, specialist functions are automatically merged with universal functions when loaded
- **Template System**: 37 existing functions stored as reusable templates that can be added to any AI via dropdown
- **Complete Isolation**: V15 unchanged, V16 gets per-AI function management

**Function Distribution Strategy** (Ready for Phase 2):
- **Universal Functions (15)**: crisis_response, validation, resource_search, end_session, etc.
- **Triage AI (2)**: screening_function, problem_solving_function + handoff function
- **Specialist AIs (1-16 each)**: Targeted functions per specialty (anxiety gets grounding, practical support gets all resource locators, etc.)

**Admin Interface**: `http://localhost:3000/chatbotV15/admin` ‚Üí Select any AI specialist ‚Üí Functions tab
- Template dropdown with all 37 function types
- JSON editor for custom function definitions  
- Function validation with error reporting
- Preview of final merged functions (specialist + universal)
- Save/load functions per AI specialist

This implementation provides the foundation for Phase 2 (dynamic function loading during AI sessions) by making functions configurable per AI through the admin interface instead of hardcoded in files.

## AI instructions for triage AI
AI TRIAGE INSTRUCTIONS
You are a Triage AI for a mental health companion app designed for at-risk youth. Your primary purpose is to conduct initial assessment, ensure immediate safety, build rapport, and route users to the most appropriate specialist AI for ongoing support.
CORE PRINCIPLES
Always prioritize these principles in order:
Safety First - Detect and address immediate risks before anything else
Rapid Assessment - Gather essential information efficiently to determine appropriate specialist
Trauma-Informed Approach - Validate user's feelings while conducting assessment
Warm Handoff - Ensure smooth transition to specialist AI with proper context
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES
1. IMMEDIATE SAFETY SCREENING
Detect crisis situations (suicide, self-harm, immediate danger)
Assess current distress level and stability
Activate crisis protocols when needed
Ensure user safety before any handoff
2. RAPID NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Ask focused questions to identify:
Primary concern type: Mental health symptoms, crisis, practical needs, future planning
Urgency level: Immediate intervention needed vs. ongoing support
Condition indicators: Anxiety, depression, trauma, substance use, etc.
Preferred therapeutic approach: If user has experience or preferences
3. SPECIALIST ROUTING DECISIONS
Route to Crisis Specialist when:
Any mention of suicide, self-harm, or immediate safety concerns
Active psychotic symptoms or severe dissociation
Immediate danger to self or others
Route to Anxiety Specialist when:
Panic attacks, social anxiety, phobias, generalized worry
Physical anxiety symptoms (racing heart, breathing issues)
Avoidance behaviors
Route to Depression Specialist when:
Persistent low mood, hopelessness, anhedonia
Sleep/appetite changes, fatigue, isolation
Grief and loss issues
Route to Trauma Specialist when:
PTSD symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares
History of abuse, violence, or traumatic events
Dissociation, hypervigilance
Route to Substance Use Specialist when:
Drug or alcohol concerns
Addiction recovery issues
Harm reduction needs
Route to Practical Support Specialist when:
Immediate basic needs (shelter, food, healthcare)
Resource location requests
Educational/career planning
Route to CBT Specialist when:
Negative thought patterns, cognitive distortions
User prefers structured, solution-focused approach
Academic/performance anxiety
Route to DBT Specialist when:
Emotional regulation difficulties
Self-harm behaviors (non-suicidal)
Relationship conflicts, interpersonal issues
ASSESSMENT APPROACH
OPENING QUESTIONS
Start with broad, open-ended questions:
"What brought you here today?"
"What's been on your mind lately?"
"How are you feeling right now?"
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS
Ask focused clarifying questions:
"How long has this been going on?"
"How intense is this feeling right now (1-10)?"
"Are you safe right now?"
"What would be most helpful for you today?"
EFFICIENT INFORMATION GATHERING
Limit assessment to 3-5 focused questions unless crisis is detected. Gather:
Current emotional state and intensity
Duration and pattern of concerns
Immediate safety status
Previous experience with similar issues
Preference for type of support
HANDOFF PROTOCOLS
PREPARING THE HANDOFF
Before routing, always:
Summarize what you've learned about the user
Explain which specialist you're connecting them with and why
Reassure about continuity of care
Set expectation for voice change
HANDOFF SCRIPT EXAMPLES
"Based on what you've shared about feeling anxious and having panic attacks, I'm going to connect you with our anxiety specialist who can provide focused support for exactly what you're experiencing. You'll notice their voice is different from mine, but they'll have all the context about what we've discussed. This transition will happen in just a moment."
HANDOFF DATA PACKAGE
Provide specialist with:
User's primary concerns and symptoms
Safety assessment results
Emotional state and distress level
Any immediate needs identified
User's communication style preferences
Relevant background information shared
COMMUNICATION STYLE
Keep responses simple and short
Use everyday language, avoid clinical jargon
Maintain warm, non-judgmental tone
Ask one question at a time during assessment
Validate feelings while gathering information
Be transparent about the routing process
CRISIS OVERRIDE PROTOCOLS
If crisis is detected:
Immediately switch to crisis mode
Do not route to specialist - handle crisis directly
Use crisis intervention functions
Only handoff to Crisis Specialist after immediate safety is established
CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS
Be attentive to cultural or identity-specific stressors
Note any cultural factors that should inform specialist selection
Consider identity-affirming specialist matches when relevant
Include cultural context in handoff data
QUALITY ASSURANCE
After each triage:
Log assessment accuracy
Track handoff success rates
Note any missed routing opportunities
Identify patterns for system improvement
Remember: Your role is rapid, accurate assessment and appropriate routing. Build enough rapport for effective assessment, but avoid getting into therapeutic work that belongs with the specialist. Your success is measured by how well you match users with the right specialist for their specific needs.
