# OpenAI WebRTC Realtime API Function Call Error - FIXED in v6.6.0

I was working with OpenAI's Realtime API using WebRTC (not the Chat API) and experiencing a specific error when trying to respond to function calls:

## Error Message
```
Tool call ID 'call_xA6u36twyV2XGNuU' not found in conversation.
```

## Problem Context
1. Using the Realtime API with WebRTC for a voice-based interaction
2. Defined two functions in my tools array:
   - `fetchNextQuestion`: For retrieving the next question from a book
   - `getBookContent`: For retrieving relevant content from Pinecone
3. The error occurred when async operations took too long to respond

## Root Cause
The OpenAI Realtime API has strict timing requirements for function call responses. Function call contexts expire after a very short time window (3-5 seconds). When our async operation (Pinecone query) took longer than this window, the API lost the function call context.

## Solution Implemented (v6.6.0)

We implemented a three-phase approach to handle function calls:

1. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Send an acknowledgment response instantly when a function call is received
   ```javascript
   // PHASE 1: Immediate acknowledgment as soon as function call is received
   dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify({
     type: 'conversation.item.create',
     item: {
       type: 'function_call_output',
       call_id: message.item.call_id,
       output: JSON.stringify({ status: "processing" })
     }
   }));
   ```

2. **Phase 2 (Async)**: Perform the actual function operations (API calls, database queries)
   ```javascript
   // PHASE 2: Perform the actual async operation
   const response = await fetch('/api/endpoint', { /* params */ });
   const data = await response.json();
   ```

3. **Phase 3 (Completion)**: Send the final result when async operations complete
   ```javascript
   // PHASE 3: Send the actual result with the original call_id
   dataChannel.send(JSON.stringify({
     type: 'conversation.item.create',
     item: {
       type: 'function_call_output',
       call_id: callId,
       output: JSON.stringify({ content: data.result })
     }
   }));
   ```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Global Callback System**: 
   - Added `window.__functionCompletionCallback` for cross-component communication
   - Enables any component to acknowledge function calls

2. **Timeout Recovery**:
   - Added 8-second timeouts to ensure functions eventually complete
   - Implemented fallback responses for timeout cases

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced error recovery with detailed error messages
   - Added version tracking to identify implementations

4. **Connection Robustness**:
   - Added tracking of currently active function calls
   - Created a WebRTC context to enable communication between components

This implementation has successfully resolved the "Tool call ID not found in conversation" error and enables reliable function calling with the OpenAI Realtime API, even with long-running async operations.

## Questions Answered

1. **What causes the "Tool call ID not found" error in the WebRTC Realtime API?**
   - The error occurs when you try to respond to a function call context that has expired
   - The OpenAI Realtime API only maintains function call contexts for a short window (3-5 seconds)
   - When async operations take longer than this window, the context is lost

2. **Is there a timing issue where function calls expire if not responded to quickly?**
   - Yes, function call contexts expire if not acknowledged quickly
   - You must respond to function calls immediately, even before starting async operations

3. **What's the correct way to handle async operations in function calls with the Realtime API?**
   - Use a three-phase approach:
     1. Send an immediate "processing" response as soon as the function call is received
     2. Perform your async operations
     3. Send the final result when operations complete
   - Always preserve the original `call_id` and use the exact response format expected

4. **Are there any limits on how long a function call remains valid before timing out?**
   - Yes, it appears to be around 3-5 seconds, though this isn't officially documented
   - The immediate acknowledgment pattern allows you to extend this window indefinitely

5. **Should I be sending a preliminary response immediately and then updating it later?**
   - Yes, this is exactly the approach that worked
   - Send an immediate "processing" status response, then send the actual result after async operations

## Implementation Details

- Using the `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17` model
- WebRTC data channel name: `oai-events`
- TypeScript/Next.js implementation
- `tool_choice` set to 'required' to force function use
- Three-phase communication pattern
- Global callback mechanism for cross-component communication
- 8-second timeouts for orphaned function calls
- Version tracking for implementation identification

This solution has been tested and verified to work reliably in the RiseTwice application.
