  - WebRTC conversation continues unaffected
  - Recording runs completely in parallel

  Batch Processing:
  - Audio stored in browser memory during session
  - Single upload after recording stops
  - No real-time network calls during conversation

  Voice Cloning Optimized:
  - High-quality audio capture (44.1kHz, opus codec)
  - Large chunks (30-second intervals) reduce processing overhead
  - Proper file naming for organization
