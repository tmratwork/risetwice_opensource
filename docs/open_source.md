# Open Source Preparation Checklist

This document outlines the critical security issues and tasks that must be completed before making this repository public.

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

These issues **MUST** be resolved before making the repository public, as they expose production systems and user data.

### 1. Live API Keys in Environment Files
**Files:** `.env.local`, `.env.development`

**Exposed Credentials:**
- OpenAI API Key (live production key with full access)
- Anthropic API Key (live production key with full access)
- Supabase Service Role Key (full database admin access)
- Firebase complete configuration including API keys
- Pinecone API Key (vector database access)
- Agora App ID, Certificate, and other credentials
- TextBelt SMS API Key (messaging service access)
- Resend Email API Key (email service access)
- Mapbox Token (mapping service access)
- MathPix Credentials (math processing service)
- Webhook API Keys for function calling

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all production services and user data.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: API keys from this analysis were accidentally included in this documentation file and committed to GitHub. ALL EXPOSED KEYS MUST BE ROTATED IMMEDIATELY.

### 2. Unauthenticated Admin Endpoints
**Files:**
- `src/app/api/admin/unique-users/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/usage-stats/route.ts`

**Issues:**
- No authentication checks
- Expose sensitive user data and usage statistics
- Anyone can access detailed user information

**Impact:** Privacy violation and data exposure of all users.

### 3. Dev Tools SQL Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/dev-tools/execute-sql/route.ts`

**Issues:**
- Uses service role key with full database privileges
- No authentication or authorization checks
- Attempts to call Supabase RPC functions with arbitrary parameters
- Logs potentially sensitive SQL queries
- Exposes database structure through error messages

**Impact:** Unauthorized access with admin privileges, information disclosure, potential resource abuse.

### 4. Weak Scheduled Task Authentication
**Files:**
- `src/app/api/v15/scheduled-memory-processing/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/v16/scheduled-memory-processing/route.ts`

**Issues:**
- Only checks `vercel-cron` user agent (easily spoofed)
- Processes sensitive user memory data
- Can be triggered by malicious actors

**Impact:** Resource exhaustion and unauthorized data processing.

### 5. Hardcoded Production Infrastructure
**Multiple Files**

**Exposed Information:**
- Production domain: `https://www.r2ai.me`
- Internal service references
- Production configuration details

**Impact:** Reveals production infrastructure and attack surface.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY SECURITY ISSUES

### 6. Database Operations Without Access Controls
**Issue:** Many Supabase operations use service role key directly without proper Row Level Security (RLS) enforcement or user permission checks.

**Specific Problems:**
- Service role key bypasses all security policies
- No Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on sensitive tables
- Users can potentially access data they shouldn't see
- Admin operations mixed with regular user operations
- Missing role-based access controls for different user types

**Solution:** Implement comprehensive RLS policies and use proper authentication patterns.

### 7. Authentication Bypass Potential
**File:** `src/contexts/auth-context.tsx`
**Issue:** Firebase authentication allows graceful degradation to anonymous users, potentially bypassing security controls.

### 8. Extensive Debug Logging
**Issue:** 5,745 console.log/debug statements across 241 files may expose sensitive data, API keys, or user information.

### 9. Community Features Without Moderation
**Issue:** User-generated content, file uploads, and voting systems lack proper moderation and spam protection controls.

## üìã PRE-OPEN SOURCE TODO LIST

### Critical Tasks (Must Complete)
- [ ] **Remove all live API keys** from `.env.local` and `.env.development`
- [ ] **Create `.env.example` templates** with placeholder values
- [ ] **Add authentication to admin endpoints** - implement user role-based authentication (check for admin status)
- [ ] **Remove or secure dev-tools endpoints** - delete SQL execution endpoint
- [ ] **Replace hardcoded URLs** with environment variables
- [ ] **Implement proper database access controls** with Row Level Security (RLS) policies and role-based permissions
- [ ] **Audit git commit history** for exposed secrets (NOTE: All history becomes public permanently)
- [ ] **Rotate all exposed API keys** if found in git history

### High Priority Tasks
- [ ] **Strengthen scheduled task authentication** beyond user-agent checks
- [ ] **Review authentication context** for bypass vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Audit debug logging** for sensitive data exposure across 5,745 log statements
- [ ] **Add community moderation controls** for user-generated content
- [ ] **Implement rate limiting** on all API endpoints
- [ ] **Add input validation and sanitization** to prevent injection attacks

### Medium Priority Tasks
- [ ] **Add environment variable validation** to ensure required secrets are configured
- [ ] **Create security setup documentation** for contributors
- [ ] **Review third-party assets** for appropriate licensing
- [ ] **Create comprehensive README.md** with setup instructions
- [ ] **Add LICENSE file** (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)

### Low Priority Tasks
- [ ] **Create GitHub issue templates** and PR templates
- [ ] **Create CONTRIBUTING.md** with development guidelines
- [ ] **Add code of conduct** and contribution guidelines

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Git History Privacy
**Once a GitHub repository is made public, ALL commit history becomes permanently public.** There is no way to hide previous commits or issues. If secrets have been committed in the past:

1. **All exposed secrets must be rotated immediately**
2. **Consider creating a fresh repository** with clean history if exposure is severe
3. **Review every commit** for accidentally committed sensitive data

### Files That Must Not Be Public
- `.env.local` (contains live production credentials)
- `.env.development` (contains development secrets)
- Any files with hardcoded credentials or internal references

### Supabase Database Security Implementation
**Priority: Critical - Must implement before going public**

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This project uses **Firebase Authentication**, not Supabase Auth. RLS policies must NOT use `auth.uid()` which only works with Supabase Auth. All policies should be designed for Firebase auth integration.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Enabling RLS will break existing functionality. Follow the safe implementation plan below.

#### Critical Operations That Will Break with RLS

**Admin/Analytics Endpoints:**
- `/api/admin/unique-users` - Cannot aggregate data across all users
- `/api/admin/usage-stats` - Cannot access usage statistics from other users
- All admin dashboards will lose cross-user visibility

**Scheduled Background Processing:**
- `/api/v15/scheduled-memory-processing` - Cannot find users needing memory processing
- `/api/v16/scheduled-memory-processing` - Cannot access conversations across users
- Daily cron jobs will fail to process user data

**Community Features:**
- `/api/v16/community/posts` - Cannot show posts from other users in feeds
- `/api/v16/community/moderation` - Cannot moderate content from other users
- Cross-user interactions will be blocked

**Usage Tracking & Analytics:**
- All cross-user aggregation queries will fail
- Analytics endpoints cannot compile user statistics
- Tracking systems cannot record events for other users

#### Production RLS Implementation Plan

**‚ö†Ô∏è SIMPLIFIED APPROACH**: Implement RLS directly on production database, table by table, with enhanced error visibility.

**Note**: Claude Code has read-only access to Supabase via MCP. SQL changes must be executed manually in Supabase console after Claude generates the statements.

**Phase 1: Enhanced Error Detection**
Add comprehensive RLS violation detection to catch any missed code:

```javascript
// Global error handler for RLS violations
window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', (event) => {
  if (event.reason.message.includes('row-level security policy')) {
    console.error('üö® RLS VIOLATION DETECTED üö®', {
      table: extractTableFromError(event.reason),
      location: event.reason.stack,
      query: event.reason.details,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
    // Make failures very visible in development
    alert(`RLS VIOLATION: ${event.reason.message}`);
  }
});
```

**Phase 2: Database Setup**
```sql
-- Add admin column to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
-- Set admin user(s)
UPDATE users SET is_admin = TRUE WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

**Phase 3: Table-by-Table RLS Rollout**
Enable RLS on one table at a time, starting with least critical:

```sql
-- 1. Start with non-critical tables
ALTER TABLE user_feedback ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users own feedback" ON user_feedback FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 2. Test areas that use user_feedback table
-- 3. Fix any RLS violations found
-- 4. Move to next table

ALTER TABLE analytics_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users own events" ON analytics_events FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 5. Continue with increasingly critical tables
ALTER TABLE conversations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Phase 4: Security Policies for Each Table**
Create appropriate policies as each table gets RLS enabled:

```sql
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è FIREBASE AUTH COMPATIBLE POLICIES - DO NOT USE auth.uid()
-- Regular users see only their own data (user_id comes from Firebase)
CREATE POLICY "Users view own conversations" ON conversations
  FOR SELECT USING (user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true));

-- Admin users see all data (requires Firebase user ID lookup in user_profiles)
CREATE POLICY "Admins view all conversations" ON conversations
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
      WHERE user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)
      AND is_admin = true
    )
  );
```

#### Testing Strategy (Streamlined)
1. **Enable RLS on single table** (start with user_feedback or analytics_events)
2. **Identify code areas** that use that specific table through search
3. **Simple targeted testing** of only those identified areas
4. **Monitor error logs** for RLS violations during normal usage
5. **Fix any violations found** before moving to next table
6. **Repeat for each table** progressively

#### Error Visibility Requirements
- RLS violations must throw clear, visible errors
- Failed queries must log table name and query details
- Development environment should show popup alerts for RLS failures
- Production should log detailed RLS violation information

#### Table Priority Order
1. **user_feedback** (lowest impact)
2. **analytics_events** (low impact)
3. **usage_sessions** (medium impact)
4. **conversation_analyses** (medium impact)
5. **conversations** (high impact)
6. **messages** (high impact)
7. **users** (highest impact - do last)

#### Admin Role Implementation
- Add `is_admin` boolean column to users table
- Update admin endpoints to check user authentication + admin status
- Create service functions for legitimate cross-user operations
- Replace service role key usage with proper user authentication where possible

### Security Testing Recommendations
Before going public:
1. **Test RLS policies** with different user roles (regular user, admin, anonymous)
2. **Penetration testing** of all API endpoints
3. **Security code review** by external security expert
4. **Automated security scanning** with tools like Snyk or GitHub Security
5. **Load testing** with rate limiting disabled to identify DoS vulnerabilities

## üîí Security Contact
For security-related issues after open sourcing, establish:
- Security email contact
- Responsible disclosure policy
- Security advisory process through GitHub Security Advisories

**Status:** Repository is NOT ready for public release. Critical security vulnerabilities must be resolved first.

## ü§ñ Claude Code Guidelines for Security Analysis

**CRITICAL RULE**: When analyzing environment files or API keys:
- **NEVER include actual API keys, tokens, or credentials in documentation**
- **NEVER paste partial keys or identifying portions**
- **ONLY describe the TYPE of credential found (e.g., "OpenAI API Key found")**
- **ALWAYS use placeholder text like "[REDACTED]" for sensitive values**

This prevents accidental exposure of live credentials when documentation is committed to version control.

# completed RLS update for:
user_profiles
