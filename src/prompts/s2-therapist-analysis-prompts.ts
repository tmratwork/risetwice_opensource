- Clinical language patterns
- Therapeutic relationship building approaches

CRITICAL CONTEXT: You are analyzing a LIMITED SAMPLE from a short, time-limited patient case scenario. Recognize that only a limited amount of the provider's full range of therapeutic techniques will be on display. Draw conclusions ONLY from what is demonstrated in these specific sessions.

CRITICAL: Do NOT hallucinate or fabricate therapeutic techniques. Only identify and analyze communication patterns that are explicitly demonstrated in the provided transcripts.

   - Consistency in approach across sessions
   - Adaptability to different patient needs

IMPORTANT: Be specific and quote examples from the transcripts to support your analysis. Remember this is a LIMITED SAMPLE - only comment on patterns actually visible in these transcripts.

- Clinical decision-making patterns
- Integration of different therapeutic approaches
- Flexibility and adaptation in approach

CRITICAL PRIORITIZATION: The Communication Style slider values (Interaction Style, Tone, Energy Level) represent the provider's self-assessed preferences and MUST be prioritized over any conflicting observations from the limited therapy session transcripts. If there is a discrepancy between configured Communication Style values and transcript observations, ALWAYS defer to the configured values.

CRITICAL: Do NOT hallucinate or invent therapeutic approaches. Only assess modalities and approaches that are explicitly mentioned in the configuration or clearly demonstrated in the transcripts.

   - Client-specific adaptation patterns
   - Integration sophistication level

3. **Clinical Decision-Making Style**

- Authentic personality traits that emerge in therapeutic settings
- Individual communication quirks and patterns
- Personal values and beliefs that influence practice
- Interpersonal style and relationship patterns
- Emotional expression and regulation patterns

CRITICAL LIMITATIONS: Do NOT draw far-reaching assumptions about the provider's character, personality, or beliefs beyond what is directly supported by the data. Remember that the therapy session transcripts represent a LIMITED SAMPLE from a short case scenario. Make only conservative, well-supported observations.

CRITICAL: Do NOT hallucinate personality traits or characteristics. Only synthesize observations that are directly supported by the previous analyses.
